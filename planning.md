# Project Proposal
After a 10-minute review of each of the other data sets, we unanimously agreed to do datasets on 
tourist information and leisure points. We chose leisure and tourist information because we both 
concluded that it would be the most suitable for the two of us to work on.

## Business Case
Multi-cultural Tourist Information Website

### Problem statement
Countless international tourists have been visiting the city of Bristol who have been unable to find
relevant information they can understand easily. This leads to said tourists getting lost
and/or spending hours each day looking for satisfactory hotspots to no avail. While this problem is 
easily averted by hiring a tour guide, they must pay extra to hire them and that is not cost-effective.
Alternatively, they could find the places they want to visit at tourist information offices, but that 
will also take time to locate and to get past the language barrier. 
Hence why our website is going to be a multicultural one with cultural-based algorithm. It will aid 
in assisting tourists to find more local hotspots relevant to them and give them translation options (eg. 
subtitles to allow them to get familiar with the English language) for effortless comprehension. Our 
website will also provide an offer to get up-to-date recommendations from other international users and 
tourist giving them the option to make a new friend along the way. This website also aims to be as 
user-friendly as possible by appealing to many individuals regardless of age, disability, etc, thus it is 
also welcoming to local tourists, especially those looking to explore different cultures.

### Business benefits
Quick- This website will not take very long to develop as it is dedicated to one primary aim that is also
 extremely simple; a map pinpointing tourist information points across Bristol.

User Experience - Expanding reach and accessibility. Creating an inclusive and welcoming digital experience for diverse users.

Cost-effective (free)- No funding will be necessary to build this website as HTML5, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT 
are free coding languages that will be used to assemble this webpage. In addition, potential external 
sources such as Google Maps will also arrive at no extra cost.

Customer/User Satisfaction- This web app will be extremely resourceful for tourists because of how 
convenient it is. This website will be widely available on mobile phones, tablets, and PC/laptops, which 
will provide massive assistance to tourists, improve customer satisfaction, and boost the business' brand.

Recommendations - Our app will also provide suggestions of places to visit from other users of the app 
as well as recommendations from top/popular places visited with a link to their reviews.    


### Options Considered
Tour guides and tourist information points - As mentioned earlier, tourists can pay for a tour guide to show them all of the popular spots all around Bristol. One advantage this website has over tour guides is that it's completely free. One advantage that tour guides have over the website is that they have human input, meaning that tour guides can show the tourists more than what the website can such as tours in the popular zones in Bristol, historical storytelling, etc. 

Social media - Tourist have numerous options for tour guidance on social media such as YouTube, google, and TikTok to name a few. These options provide more human judgment than tour guides as actual tourists with unbiased opinions are giving their views on the experience and the places of high interest which is an advantage that social media has over the website. 
   
TODO: What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?

### Expected Risks
Data security- Users will input their personal information when signing in to their accounts on the 
website. If the website's security is not up to scratch, it will be vulnerable to data breaches and will 
in turn violate the GDPR guidelines. 
Outdated/innacurate information- Changes are made to Bristol all of the time, including information points being relocated. If the website does not provide up-to-date information, it will harm the business' reputation amongst the target audience.  
High competition- The travel industry is massively competitive to where thousands of tourist information point map websites have already been developed. This may lead to this website being overshadowed by other webpages with a monopoly in this industry like Google maps.
