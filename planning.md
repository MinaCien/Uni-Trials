# Project Proposal
Mina and I have unanimously agreed to do datasets on tourist information points after having
a 10 minute look through each of the other data sets. We chose tourist information because we
both concluded that it would be the most suited for the 2 of us to work on.

## Business Case
Tourist information office map


### Problem statement
Countless tourists visiting not just Bristol, but other parts of the world explore where they
are visiting without the relevant information. This leads to said tourists getting lost and 
spending hours each day looking for the hotspots to no avail. While this problem is easily 
averted by hiring a tour guide, they must pay extra to hire them and that is money spent unnecessarily. 
Instead, they can find the places they want to visit at tourist information offices, but they will need
to know how to locate these offices; this is where our website comes into play. Our website aims to make
finding tourist information offices across Bristol easier for both regulars who want to explore more of
Bristol and tourists from different parts of the UK and even the world. This website also aims to be as 
user-friendly as possible by appealing to as many of the people as possible regardless of age, disability, etc.

### Business benefits
Quick- This website will not take very long to develop as it is dedicated to one primary aim that is 
also extremely simple; a map pinpointing tourist information points across Bristol.
Cost effective (free)- No funding will be necessary to build this website as HTML5, CSS and JAVASCRIPT 
are free coding languages that will be used to assemble this webpage. In addition, potential external 
sources such as google maps will also arrive at no extra cost.
Customer/User satisfaciton- This webapp will be extremely resourceful for tourists because of how 
convinient it is. This website will be widely available on mobile phones, tablets and PC/laptops, which 
will provide massive assistance to tourists, improve customer satisfaction and boost the business' brand.     


### Options Considered
Tour guides- As mentioned earlier, tourists can pay for a tour guide to show them all of the popular 
spots all around Bristol. One advantage this website has over tour guides is that it's completely free. 
One advantage that tour guides have over the website is that they have human input, meaning that tour 
guides can show the tourists more than what the website can such as tours in the popular zones in Bristol,
historical storytelling, etc. 
Social media- Tourist have numerous options for tour guidance on social media such as youtube, google 
and TikTok to name a few. These options provide more human judgement than tour guides as actual tourists 
with unbiased opinions are giving their views on the experience and the places of high interest which is 
an advantage that social media has over the website. 
   
TODO: What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?

### Expected Risks
Data security- Users will input their personal information when signing in to their accounts on the 
website. If the website's security is not up to scratch, it will be vulnerable to data breaches and will 
in turn violate the GDPR guidelines. 
Outdated/innacurate information- Changes are made to Bristol all of the time, including information 
points being relocated. If the website does not provide up-to-date information, it will harm the 
business' reputation amongst the target audience.  
High competition- The travel industry is massively competitive to where thousands of tourist information 
point map websites have already been developed. This may lead to this website being overshadowed by other
webpages with a monopoly in this industry like Google maps.
